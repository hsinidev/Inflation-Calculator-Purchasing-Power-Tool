## 🎯 About The Project

The **Inflation Calculator** is a sleek, modern financial tool designed to provide clear insights into the historical value of money. It elegantly demonstrates how inflation affects purchasing power by comparing the value of a currency between two different years. With its immersive animated galaxy background and an intuitive interface, it makes understanding complex financial concepts simple and engaging.

This project serves as both a practical utility for anyone interested in finance and a demonstration of modern frontend development practices using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (version 16.x or later) and a package manager like npm or yarn installed on your machine.

*   **npm**
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hsinidev/inflation-calculator.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd inflation-calculator
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *Using npm:*
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    *Or using yarn:*
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

*   *Using npm:*
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
*   *Or using yarn:*
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## 💡 Usage

The application provides a straightforward interface for calculating the impact of inflation. The calculation is based on the standard formula using mock Consumer Price Index (CPI) data:

`Equivalent Value = Initial Amount * (CPI of End Year / CPI of Start Year)`

1.  Navigate to the main page.
2.  Enter the **Initial Amount** you want to analyze.
3.  Provide a **Start Year** and an **End Year** for the period of comparison.
4.  Click the **"Calculate Purchasing Power"** button.
5.  The results will be displayed instantly, showing the equivalent value in the end year, the total inflation rate, and the amount of purchasing power lost.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

-   [ ] **Data Visualization**: Implement charts to visually represent inflation trends over time.
-   [ ] **Real API Integration**: Replace the mock CPI data with a live financial data API.
-   [ ] **Currency Selection**: Add support for multiple currencies (e.g., EUR, GBP, JPY).
-   [ ] **Advanced Projections**: Allow users to project future inflation based on different rate assumptions.
